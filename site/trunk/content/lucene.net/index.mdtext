Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. The Lucene search library is based on an [inverted index](http://lucene.sourceforge.net/talks/pisa/). Lucene.Net has three primary goals: 

1.  Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule;
2.  Maintaining the high-performance requirements excepted of a first class C# search engine library;
3.  Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.
