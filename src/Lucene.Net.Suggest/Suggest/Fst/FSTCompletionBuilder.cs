    /// <item><description>A set of input terms and their buckets is given.</description></item>
    /// <item><description>All terms in the input are prefixed with a synthetic pseudo-character
    /// (code) of the weight bucket the term fell into. For example a term
    /// <c>abc</c> with a discretized weight equal '1' would become
    /// <c>1abc</c>.</description></item>
    /// <item><description>The terms are then sorted by their raw value of UTF-8 character values
    /// (including the synthetic bucket code in front).</description></item>
    /// <item><description>A finite state automaton (<see cref="FST"/>) is constructed from the input. The
    /// root node has arcs labeled with all possible weights. We cache all these
    /// arcs, highest-weight first.</description></item>
    /// </list>
    ///
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// At runtime, in <see cref="FSTCompletion.DoLookup(string, int)"/>,
    /// the automaton is utilized as follows:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item><description>For each possible term weight encoded in the automaton (cached arcs from
    /// the root above), starting with the highest one, we descend along the path of
    /// the input key. If the key is not a prefix of a sequence in the automaton
    /// (path ends prematurely), we exit immediately -- no completions.</description></item>
    /// <item><description>Otherwise, we have found an internal automaton node that ends the key.
    /// <b>The entire subautomaton (all paths) starting from this node form the key's
    /// completions.</b> We start the traversal of this subautomaton. Every time we
    /// reach a final state (arc), we add a single suggestion to the list of results
    /// (the weight of this suggestion is constant and equal to the root path we
    /// started from). The tricky part is that because automaton edges are sorted and
    /// we scan depth-first, we can terminate the entire procedure as soon as we
    /// collect enough suggestions the user requested.</description></item>
    /// <item><description>In case the number of suggestions collected in the step above is still
