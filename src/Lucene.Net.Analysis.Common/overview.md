  Analyzers for indexing content in different languages and domains.

 For an introduction to Lucene's analysis API, see the <xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis> package documentation. 

 This module contains concrete components (<xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.CharFilter>s, <xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.Tokenizer>s, and (<xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.TokenFilter>s) for analyzing different types of content. It also provides a number of <xref:Lucene.Net.Analysis.Analyzer>s for different languages that you can use to get started quickly.
