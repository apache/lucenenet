  Analyzers for indexing content in different languages and domains.

 For an introduction to Lucene's analysis API, see the [Lucene.Net.Analysis](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.html) namespace documentation. 

 This module contains concrete components ([Lucene.Net.Analysis.CharFilter](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.CharFilter.html)s, [Lucene.Net.Analysis.Tokenizer](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Tokenizer.html)s, and [Lucene.Net.Analysis.TokenFilter](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.TokenFilter.html)s) for analyzing different types of content. It also provides a number of [Lucene.Net.Analysis.Analyzer](../core/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Analyzer.html)s for different languages that you can use to get started quickly.
