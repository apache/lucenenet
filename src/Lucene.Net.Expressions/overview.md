# The Expressions Module for Apache Lucene

 The expressions module is new to Lucene 4.6. It provides an API for dynamically computing per-document values based on string expressions. 

 The module is organized in two sections:

1. <xref:Lucene.Net.Expressions> - The abstractions and simple utilities for common operations like sorting on an expression
2. <xref:Lucene.Net.Expressions.JS> - A compiler for a subset of JavaScript expressions 

 For sample code showing how to use the API, see <xref:Lucene.Net.Expressions.Expression>.
