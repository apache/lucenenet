<h3>NUnit 2.5.5 - Version 2.5.5.10112 - April 22, 2010</h3>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Runtime Version dropdown on the <b>Project Editor</b> dialog
now includes only major and minor version numbers like 2.0 or 4.0.
When loading the tests, these versions are resolved to the highest 
version of the particular runtime available on your system. You may
still enter a complete version number in the text box if desired.
<li>The <b>DatapointsAttribute</b> may now be specified on properties
and methods as well as fields. For parameters of type T, the attribute

<h3>NUnit 2.5.4 - Version 2.5.4.10098 - April 8, 2010</h3>

<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now defaults to running an assembly under the runtime version for
which it was built. If that version is not available, a higher version may be
used. See the <a href="runtimeSelection.html">Runtime Selection</a> 
page for details.
<li><b>ProjectEditor</b> now provides a 'Default' selection for the runtime
version to be used.
<li>The XML result file format has been enhanced to provide additional information
needed to identify and report on theories and also includes extended result states
such as Inconclusive, Invalid, Error and Cancelled.
<li>The <b>EmptyConstraint</b> (Is.Empty) may now be used with a <b>DirectoryInfo</b>
to test whether the directory is empty.
<li>Datapoints for <b>boolean</b> and <b>enum</b> arguments are now generated 
automatically for theories.
<li>The cache path for shadow copying is now saved in the NUnit settings file
rather than in the config files. The settings dialog may be used to change it
if necessary.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5.3 - Version 2.5.3.9345 - December 11, 2009</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is the first release of NUnit on Launchpad.
   
<h4>Features</h4>

<ul>
<li>Test execution under .NET 4.0 is now supported. It may be selected
    in the Gui runner or using the console runner /framework option.
	NUnit test projects may specify .NET 4.0 as the required framework
	to be used for loading the the project. PlatformAttribute allows 
	testing for .NET 4.0.
<li>The distribution now includes nunit-agent-x86.exe, which is used
    for running tests in a separate process under nunit-x86.exe
	or nunit-console-x86.exe when the target framework is .NET 2.0
	or greater.
<li>Static methods Contains.Substring() and Contains.Item() have been
    added to the NUnit syntax for compatibility with NUnitLite.
<li>Non-public test fixtures are now allowed in all cases, 
    whether the TestFixtureAttribute is present or not.
<li>Abstract classes may now be marked with TestFixtureAttribute
    to indicate that derived classes are to be treated as 
	test fixtures. The abstract class is no longer marked as invalid.
<li>Fixtures without tests are no longer shown as non-runnable but
    are simply executed. If the fixture setup or teardown does not cause
	an error, they are reported as inconclusive.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reloading tests in the Gui no longer uses the default runtime if
    a different runtime was previously selected.
<li>Thread principal is now saved before each test and restored afterward
    eliminating failures under .NET 4.0.
<li>Assume.That() overload with a message no longer results in test failure.
<li>An expected Result of null is now handled correctly on parameterized tests.
<li>Duplicate caching of metadata has been eliminated, resolving a
    load performance problem when many methods are inherited from
	a base class.
<li>The names of nested generic and non-generic classes are now displayed 
    correctly.
<li>Assert.Catch&lt;T&gt; now correctly returns exception type T rather than
    System.Exception.
<li>ValueSourceAttribute now works correctly when used with an external type.
<li>The /domain=None option on nunit-console once again works correctly.
<li>Parameterized test fixture names are now displayed with the actual
    arguments used so that failures may be associated with the correct
	instantiation of the fixture.
<li>Test labels for generics are now displayed correctly by the console
    runner and in the Gui text output tab.
<li>Generic fixtures without type attributes provided are now shown
    as non-runnable rather than causing a runtime error. (1)
<li>Use of an unknown file type in the console command line no longer causes
    an error. (2)
<li>A number of tests that ran incorrectly under Linux have been fixed.
<li>A number of tests failing under .NET 4.0 have been fixed.
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ol>
<li>As a side effect of this fix, TestFixtureAttribute on a base class is
    overridden by a TestFixtureAttribute on the derived class. 
<li>This was originally reported as "crash when using /option in linux."
</ol>

<h3>NUnit 2.5.2 - Version 2.5.2.9222 - August 10, 2009</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is the last release of NUnit using source code
   maintained on Sourceforge. The CVS repository there will be kept,
   but no longer updated. After this release, the source is being
   maintained on Launchpad at http://launchpad.net/nunit-2.5.

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The new <b>SetUICultureAttribute</b> allows setting CurrentUICulture
    for the duration of a test method, fixture or assembly.
<li>The <b>TestFixture</b>, <b>TestCase</b> and <b>TestCaseData</b> attributes
    have been enhanced to allow ignoring an individual fixture instance or
	test case. Two new named parameters are provided:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Ignore</b> may be set to true to ignore an item.
	<li><b>IgnoreReason</b> may be set to specify the reason for ignoring
	    the item. If IgnoreReason is set to a non-empty string, then setting
		Ignore is optional.
	</ul>
<li><b>Assert.Catch</b> has been added with several overloads. It differs
    from <b>Assert.Throws</b> in accepting exceptions derived from the one
	that is specified. Like <b>Assert.Throws</b>, it returns the exception
	thrown when it succeeds so that further tests can be made on it.
<li>The <b>Throws</b> syntax has a number of new additions:
    <ul>
	<li><b>ThrowsTargetInvocationException</b>, <b>ThrowsArgumentException</b>
	    and <b>Throws.InvalidOperationException</b> provide a shorter syntax
		for testing for these common exception types.
	<li><b>Throws.InnerException</b> applies any constraints to the InnerException 
	    of the exception that was thrown rather than to the exception itself.
	<li><b>InnerException</b> can also be used in constraint expressions - see
	    the documentation for an example.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Data from a TestCaseSource in a separate class from the tests
    is now handled correctly.
<li>Arguments specified using TestCaseData are now used correctly.
<li>Comparing the a stream to itself no longer causes an error.
<li>TimeoutAttribute is now permitted on an assembly as documented.
<li>Clear All and Clear Failures buttons are now displayed correctly
    depending on whether Checkboxes are displayed in the Gui.
<li>The console runner option descriptions have been revised to
    more clearly indicate what each option does.
<li>Running special tests that do not use the nunit.framework assembly
    no longer causes a null reference exception.
<li>Console Runner option descriptions have been edited for accuracy.
<li>Gui TreeView now updates correctly when the order of tests has changed.
<li>An exception in TearDown now displays the actual exception
    at the top of the stack rather than a TargetInvocationException.
</ul>
<style><!--

--></style>

<h3>NUnit 2.5.1 - Version 2.5.1.9189 - July 8, 2009</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>A new <b>TestResult</b> state has been defined for tests cancelled by the
    user. Results with <b>ResultState.Cancelled</b> are reported as a type of
	failure and no longer generate an ApplicationException.
<li>Parameterized test fixtures with <b>TestCaseSource</b> or <b>ValueSource</b> 
	data are now constructed using the appropriate parameterized constructor 
	when test cases are being created. This avoids the need for a default
	constructor and permits use of member data initialized from
	the fixture parameters in creating the test data.
<li>The <b>TestCaseData</b> class now supports use of a string or other
    array type as the sole argument value, without the need to nest
	that array in an object array.
<li>Abstract classes marked with <b>TestFixtureAttribute</b> are no longer
    reported as ignored or non-runnable.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> This was changed in 2.5 but was omitted from the release notes.
<li>The methods in the <b>Text</b> class are now marked as obsolete. For string 
	constraints, use one of the following at the start of an expression:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Is.StringContaining</b>
	<li><b>Is.StringStarting</b>
	<li><b>Is.StringEnding</b>
	<li><b>Is.StringMatching</b>
	</ul>
	Within an expression (afer Not, Some, All, And, Or, etc.) you may use
	<ul>
	<li><b>Contains</b> or <b>ContainsSubstring</b>
	<li><b>StartsWith</b>
	<li><b>EndsWith</b>
	<li><b>Matches</b>	
	</ul>
<li><b>ThrowsConstraint</b> now has a constructor taking an <b>ActualValueDelegate</b>
    in addition to the constructor that takes a <b>TestDelegate</b>. This allows
	simpler use of Lambda expressions under C# 3.0, but requires users of pre-3.0
	compilers to disambiguate their delegates by use of an explicit return
	expression.
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
<li>Individual test cases under a parameterized test are
    no longer sorted by name within the test group but are
	run (and shown in the Gui) in the order in which the
	data is retrieved.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Since the order of retrieval of custom
	attributes is not guaranteed by the CLR, the order
	of test cases will not necessarily match the textual
	ordering of attributes in the source code. The order
	of tests will vary across different compilers and
	CLR versions as well.
<li>The XML test result file now contains a count of 
	inconclusive results.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The default icons in the Gui tree have been updated.
<li>Alternative icons placed by the user in the directory containing
    nunit.uikit.dll may now be in PNG format. Icons are now recognized
	for Skipped and Inconclusive status in addition to Success, Failure
	and Ignored.
<li>A new setting option allows the user to disable checking for the 
    existence of files in the Recent Files list before listing them. This
    prevents NUnit from appearing to freeze when the file is on a network
    path that is no longer connected.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <b>ITestCaseProvider2</b> and <b>IDatapointProvider2</b> interfaces
    extend <b>ITestCaseProvider</b> and <b>IDatapointProvider</b>
    with methods that include the fixture for which the test case is being
    built. Providers may implement either the old or the new interface, 
	but the new interface is required if the data source is contained in
	the test fixture itself so that the fixture may be constructed with
	the proper parameters in the case of a parameterized fixture.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Lambda in Throws constraint was not compiling correctly.
<li>Null reference exception is no longer thrown when adding an assembly to a 
    new project that has not yet been saved.
<li>Dispose is now called on disposable types created while loading test case 
    parameters.
<li>Installations that copy NUnit to a single folder (no lib or framework folders) 
    now work correctly.
<li>Test Assemblies menu item is no longer enabled when no test was loaded
<li>The Text Output tab of the Settings dialog no longer causes an exception
    when invoked from the mini-gui.
<li>Errors in various copyright statements were fixed and the year updated to 2009.
<li>Control characters in test arguments are now escaped in the display.
<li>Additional control characters are now escaped in error messages.
<li>Miscellaneous typographic corrections were made to the documentation.
</ul>
<h3>NUnit 2.5 Final Release - Version 2.5.0.9122 - May 2, 2009</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>A new syntax element, <b>Matches(Constraint)</b>, allows use of
custom constraints, predicates or lambda expressions in constraint expressions.

<li>The <b>MessageMatch</b> enum used with <b>ExpectedExceptionAttribute</b>
has been extended with a new value <b>StartsWith</b>, indicating that the
exception message must start with the string provided.

<li><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> now supports a <b>MessageMatch</b>
property.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The File menu now allows selecting an alternate runtime,
such as Mono, on a machine with multiple CLR implementations
installed. This feature is still considered experimental and
may change in the future.

<li>The combo box in the Project Editor allowing selection of
a particular runtime type such as Mono for loading the test
has been re-enabled.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Provided a workaround to a Mono 2.4 bug in handling remote 
references to an interface, where the provider is running under
MS .NET and the implementation is explicit.

<li>Fixed a problem with the display of line numbers from a German
language stack trace, with lines terminating in a period.

<li> The Console Runner display now shows the settings for ProcessModel,
DomainUsage and RuntimeFramework actually provided, before resolution
of any defaults.

<li> Removed references in the docs to pages that no longer exist.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Release Candidate - Version 2.5.0.9117 - April 27, 2009</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>The installation now uses a 'lib' subdirectory to hold dlls.

<li>The build script target names have been changed to make more sense.
In particular, 'package' now builds the default package and
targets not intended to be called directly are no longer listed
as 'Main Targets' by the -projecthelp option.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>The following Constraints now use the NUnit definition
of equality in comparing items, which may lead to changed behavior 
of some tests.
   <ul><b>
   <li>UniqueItemsConstraint
   <li>CollectionContainsConstraint
   <li>CollectionEquivalentConstraint
   <li>CollectionSubsetConstraint
   </b></ul>
The constraints listed now accept the <b>IgnoreCase</b> and <b>Using</b>
modifiers, which work exactly as they do with <b>EqualConstraint</b>
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
<li>Caching is now used to reduce the time required to load tests.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>A new submenu under <b>File</b> allows selecting a runtime version
under which to reload the tests. Reloading in this way does not affect
any runtime version setting in the project file.

<li>The project editor now provides a combo box listing known versions
of the runtime. Other versions may still be entered in the edit box.
Cross-CLR execution (for example, running Mono from .NET) has
been disabled in the Gui, since it isn't yet implemented.

<li>The new stack trace display now follows the NUnit Font settings.
The stack display uses the general gui font, while the source code
display uses the fixed font.

<li>The separate settings for Recent Files under .NET 1.1
and .NET 2.0 have been combined, since the Gui now runs exclusively
under .NET 2.0.

<li>The time required to restore the visual state of the tree after
reloading has been substantially reduced, especially for large numbers
of tests.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Use of a long assembly name for the ApplicationName of the AppDomain
was causing excessively long paths in the shadow cache.

<li>The <b>Using</b> modifier of <b>EqualConstraint</b> now works as
expected for string operands.

<li><b>TestCaseAttribute.ExpectedExceptionMessage</b> is no longer ignored.

<li>The max number of files setting was not being saved when modified
in the Gui Settings dialog.

<li>As a temporary fix, the pnunit.tests.dll has been moved to the 
same directory as pnunit-agent.exe and pnunit-launcher.exe, since
pnunit tests don't allow for setting an appbase separate from the
location of the test assembly.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Beta 3 Release - Version 2.5.0.9096 - April 6, 2009</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Gui is now built against .NET 2.0 only. Tests may still
be run under .NET 1.x by running in a separate process.

<li>The Visual Studio 2003 solution has been removed. Framework
and other components may still be built under .NET 1.x through
the NAnt script.

<li>The nunit.framework.extensions assembly has been removed
from the build.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>EqualConstraint</b> has been enhanced with
    several new modifiers, which may be used immediately after
	the Within(...) modifier to indicate how a numeric tolerance value
	should be interpreted.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Ulps</b> = as units in the last place (floating point only)
	<li><b>Percent</b> = as a percentage of expected value
	<li><b>Days</b> =  as a TimeSpan in days
	<li><b>Hours</b> = as a TimeSpan in hours
	<li><b>Minutes</b> = as a TimeSpan in minutes
	<li><b>Seconds</b> = as a TimeSpan in seconds
	<li><b>Milliseconds</b> = as a TimeSpan in milliseconds
	<li><b>Ticks</b> = as a TimeSpan in ticks
	</ul>

<li>The comparison constraints (<b>GreaterThan</b>, <b>LessThan</b>, etc.),
    <b>RangeConstraint</b> and <b>CollectionOrderedConstraint</b> may now be used 
	with 	objects that implement <b>IComparable&lt;T&gt;</b>.
    
<li>The syntax used for specifying that a collection is ordered has changed.
    <b>Is.Ordered</b> is now a property. The property name to use for ordering
	is specified using <b>Is.Ordered.By(name)</b>.
	
<li>The following constraints now accept a <b>Using</b> modifier to indicate
    that a user-specified comparer should be used:
	<ul><b>
	<li>EqualConstraint
	<li>GreaterThanConstraint
	<li>GreaterThanOrEqualConstraint
	<li>LessThanConstraint
	<li>LessThanOrEqualConstraint
	<li>RangeConstraint
	<li>CollectionOrderedConstraint
	</b></ul>
	The provided comparer may be any of the following:
	<ul><b>
	<li>IComparer
	<li>IComparer&lt;T&gt;
	<li>Comparison&lt;T&gt;
	</b></ul>
	In addition, <b>EqualConstraint</b> may use:
	<ul><b>
	<li>IEqualityComparer
	<li>IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;
	</b></ul>
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Beta 2 Release - Version 2.5.0.9015 - January 15, 2009</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now includes an implementation of <b>Theories</b>, similar to what
    is found in JUnit. Support for Theories is provided by the
	<b>Theory</b>, <b>Datapoint</b> and <b>Datapoints</b> attributes and by
	the <b>Assume.That</b> method. For more information and further links, 
	see the <a href="theory.html">TheoryAttribute</a> 
	documentation page.
<li>AssertionHelper has been updated so that the Expect overloads now
    include the signatures newly introduced for Assert.That.
<li>The code for Assert is now generated. This is in addition to the files 
    that were generated in beta-1.
<li><b>AfterConstraint</b> has been renamed to <b>DelayedConstraint</b>.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The console runner now supports a <b>/framework</b> option, which
    allows running the tests under a different version of the CLR.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Gui is now able to display the source code for test or production
    code from the stack trace, provided the assemblies contain source code
    information and the source code is available. Contributed by Irénée Hottier.
<li>Reloading the tests after changing settings in a way that modifies
    the shape of the tree is now handled correctly.
<li>The Settings Dialog now opens to the page that was last viewed.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Beta 1 Release - Version 2.5.0.8332 - November 27, 2008</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>Most of the code for elements of the constraint
    syntax is now generated. This allows us to more rapidly deploy new 
	constraints with their corresponding syntax. The file <b>SyntaxElements.txt</b>
	contains the specifications used in generating the code. At this time,
	we are including both this file and the generated files with the NUnit source,
	so that those working in other areas of the code don't have to regenerate 
	them each time they make changes.
<li>The nunit.core.extensions assembly has been removed from the build. Features
    that were previously in that assembly are now in the nunit.core assembly.
<li>All third-party addins have been removed from the build and must be
    downloaded separately from their own sites. An index of such
	addins is maintained on the NUnit site.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>New attributes are provided to control use of threads by tests. All of
   the following may be used on methods, classes or assemblies:
   <ul>
   <li><b>RequiresThreadAttribute</b> forces creation of a new thread and
       may optionally indicate the desired ApartmentState for the thread.
   <li><b>RequiresSTAAttribute</b> causes the test to run in the STA. A
       new thread is created only if the parent is not in the STA. On
	   methods, the .NET-provided STAThreadAttribute may also be used.
   <li><b>RequiresMTAAttribute</b> causes the test to run in the MTA. A
       new thread is created only if the parent is not in the MTA. On
	   methods, the .NET-provided MTAThreadAttribute may also be used.
   <li><b>TimeoutAttribute</b> is used to set the timeout for tests. When
       used on classes or assemblies, the timeout value is used as the
	   default timeout for all subordinate test cases. Test cases with
	   a timeout value run on a separate thread and return a failure
	   message if the timeout is exceeded.
   </ul>
<li>The <b>MaxTimeAttribute</b> specifies a miximum elapsed time for a
	test case. If the test takes longer, it is reported as a failure.
	This attribute was previously available as an extension.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Unlike <b>TimeoutAttribute</b>, <b>MaxTimeAttribute</b>
	does not cause the test to be cancelled, but merely times it.
<li><b>RepeatAttribute</b> causes a test case to be executed multiple
    times. This attribute was previously available as an extension.
<li><b>PairwiseAttribute</b> now works, generating all pairs of each
    argument value. [In earlier betas, it was unimpemented and simply
	generated all combinations.]
<li><b>PropertyAttribute</b> has been modified internally to use a dictionary
    of name/value pairs rather than just a single name and value. This feature
	is not exposed for direct use, but may be accessed by derived attributes
	that want to apply multiple named values to the test. For a simple 
	example of usage, see the code for <b>RequiredThreadAttribute</b>.
<li>The presence of <b>TestCaseSourceAttribute</b> on a method is now
    sufficient to identify it as a test. As with <b>TestCaseAttribute</b>,
	use of <b>TestAttribute</b> is optional.
<li><b>Assert.That</b> has been extended to allow a delegate or a reference 
	as the argument. By default, these are evaluated before being used by
	the constraint supplied but some constraints may delay evaluation. The
	new <b>AfterConstraint</b> is an example.
<li>An additional overload of <b>Assert.Throws</b> allows passing a
    constraint or constraint expression as the first argument.
<li>The syntax for AttributeConstraints has been enhanced so that further
    tests may be applied to properties of the attribute rather than just
	checking for its existence.
<li><b>AfterConstraint</b> allows delaying the application of a constraint
    until a certain time has passed. In it's simplest form, it replaces
	use of a Sleep in the code but it also supports polling, which may
	allow use of a longer maximum time while still keeping the tests as
	fast as possible. The <b>After</b> modifier is permitted on any
	constraint, but the delay applies to the entire expression up to the
	point where <b>After</b> appears. 
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Use of After with a simple value makes no sense, since
	the value will be extracted at the point of call. It's intended use
	is with delegates and references. If a delegate is used with polling,
	it may be called multiple times so only methods without side effects
	should be used in this way.
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now supports running tests in a separate process or in
    multiple processes per assembly. In addition, tests run in
	a separate process may use a different runtime version
	from that under which NUnit is running.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> In the Beta release, execution of tests under Mono 
	from a copy of NUnit that is running under .NET is not yet supported.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The new <b>/process:xxxxx</b> command line option is used to run
    tests in a separate process or in multiple processes per assembly.
<li>A new commandline option, <b>/timeout:nnnn</b> allows you to specify a
    default timeout value, which is applied to each test case in the run without
    a Timeout specified.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Assembly Info display now uses a scrolling text box and has
    been enhanced to show information about the Process and AppDomain
	in which the test is running and the runtime version under that
	is being used.
<li>The Project Editor now allows setting the ProcessModel and
    DomainUsage for a project to control how that project is
	loaded and run. It also supports setting a target runtime
	framework for each configuration. If the target runtime is
	different from the runtime under which NUnit is running, the
	tests will be run automatically in a separate process under
	the target runtime.
<li>The Project Editor no longer reloads the tests as each
    individual change is made. Tests are reloaded after the
	editor is closed and only if changes have been made to
	the overall project configuration or to the active
	configuration.
<li>The "Options" dialog is now called "Settings."
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The implementation of constraints has been changed so that it is no
    longer necessary to create an additional "Modifier" class when a
	custom constraint takes modifiers. If you simply implement each modifier
	as a property or method returning the object itself, it will be 
	usable in the full range of constraint expressions.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Although you can readily create custom constraints,
	this release of NUnit still lacks the ability to create new syntactic
	elements without rebuilding the framework.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Loading a single assembly and then adding another assembly using
    the Add Assembly menu item was not working correctly.
<li>Reloading tests after settings changes was failing when the
    new settings changed the shape of the tree in such a way
	that the new tests didn't match the old ones correctly.
<li>The Reload Project menu item was followed by a prompt asking
    if the current project state should be saved first and making
	the reload work in an unexpected way if you answered yes.
<li>A class without a TestFixture attribute, containing only
    TestCase methods, without any Tests, was not recognized as
	a test fixture.
<li>Assert.DoesNotThrow was failing to display a user message.
<li>Xml documentation for Assert.IsNotEmpty and Assert.AreEqual
    was incorrect.
<li>CollectionAssert.AreEqual and EqualConstraint were not
    working with IEnumerables that were not also Collections.
<li>PlatformAttribute now distinguishes correctly between
    Vista and Windows 2008 Server.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Alpha 4 Release - Version 2.5.0.8528 - September 14, 2008</h3>

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use of the TestFixtureAttribute is now optional in designating
    classes that contain tests.
<li>More than one method may now be marked with the <b>SetUp</b>, <b>TearDown</b>,
	<b>TestFixtureSetUp</b> and <b>TestFixtureTearDown</b> attributes. Setups
	in a base class are executed before those in a derived class and teardowns
	are executed in the reverse order. If there are multiple setups or teardowns
	defined at the same level, the order is unspecified so this practice is
	not generally recommended.
<li>The <b>FactoryAttribute</b> and <b>TestCaseFactoryAttribute</b> introduced 
   in alhpa-3 have been removed. The new <b>TestCaseSourceAttribute</b> allows
	specification of the name of the source of test cases and - optionally - the 
	type providing the source if it is not the same as the type that contains the 
	test. Only one source may be specified per attribute but the attribute may be 
	applied more than once to indicate multiple sources.
<li>It is now possibe to specify Categories and Properties on test cases
    defined using the TestCaseData class.
<li>Named fields, properties or methods may be used to provide values for
    individual method parameters using the new <b>ValueSourceAttribute</b>.
<li>New constraints and corresponding syntactic constructs are provided: 
	<ul>
	<li><b>Is.InRange</b> tests that a value lies within a specified range.
	<li><b>Has.Attribute()</b> tests for the presence of a specified attribute
		on a type.
	<li><b>Is.AssignableTo</b> allows reversing the operands of AssignableFrom 
		for increased clarity in the code and in any error messages when the
		actual value is of the derived type.
	<li><b>Throws.Exception</b> allows testing the exception thrown by a
	    delegate in place and provides the ability to make arbitrary tests
		on the caught exception. <b>Throws.TypeOf()</b> and <b>Throws.InstanceOf()</b>
		are provided as shorthand for the commonly used <b>Throws.Exception.TypeOf()</b>
		and <b>Throws.Exception.InstanceOf</b>.
	<li><b>Throws.Nothing</b> provides for testing that a delegate does
	    not throw. While it doesn't do much, it serves the purpose of
		converting an unexpected error into a test failure.
	</ul>
<li>The parsing of constraint expressions written using the fluent interface
    has been reorganized internally, with the following benefits:
    <ul>
	<li>Meaningless sequences like "...Null.Null..." or "...And.Or..."
	    will no longer compile - the NUnit tests actually verify this
		by attempting to compile them.
	<li>Syntax modifiers like <b>Within</b> and <b>IgnoreCase</b> are
	    now only accepted - and shown by intellisense - on constraints that
	    actually make use of them.
    <li>New <b>And</b> and <b>Or</b> infix operators are provided.
	<li>The <b>With</b> provides some ability to group constraints.
    </ul>	
    
	<p><p><b>Note:</b> Operators are evaluated in the following order:
	<ol>
	<li>Postfix modifiers (highest)
	<li>Not Operator
	<li>And operator (see below)
	<li>Or operator  (see below)
	<li>With operator
	<li>Some, None and All operators
	<li>And operator when followed directly by Some, None or All
	<li>Or operator when followed directly by Some, None or All
	<li>Overloaded operator &amp;
	<li>Overloaded operator | (lowest)
	</ol>
	Operators of equal precedence associate left to right.
	
<li>The "syntax helper" classes, <b>Is</b>, <b>Has</b>, <b>Text</b> and
    <b>List</b> have been moved to the NUnit.Framework namespace, since they 
	seem to have entered the mainstream.
<li>NUnit 2.5 is able to recognize, load and run NUnitLite tests.
<li>PropertyConstraint now works with Types when testing for the
    existence of a named property.
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>
<ul>
<li>Experimental support is provided for running tests in a separate process.
    Currently, this is only exposed in the Gui runner.
<li>NUnit recognizes a special attribute on
    the config element of the nunit project file, <b>runtimeFramework</b>,
	which may be set to "net-1.1" or "net-2.0." This causes use of the
	appropriate runner if tests are run in a separate process.
	<p><p>
	<b>Note:</b> Both of the above features are experimental and
	somewhat fragile. Results are expected to vary for different
	installations and we ask that problems be reported.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Addin Dialog now shows an error message for any addin that
    fails to load.  (from 2.4.8)
<li>The TestLoader settings dialog provides an option for running tests
    in a separate process.
<li>The Assembly Info display now shows two runtime versions for each
    test assembly: the one for which it was built and the one under
	which it is currently loaded.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <b>RequiredAddinAttribute</b> is now only permitted at the assembly level.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Gui output panes were failing to use a fixed font. (from 2.4.8)
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Alpha 3 Release - Version 2.5.0.8189 - July 7, 2008</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now uses a new version numbering scheme. The first three
    dot-separated values represent the release level, as before, while 
	the fourth is a build number tied to the date of the release. This 
	alpha release, for example, is numbered 2.5.0.8189.
<li>The NUnit source now includes a VS2008 project, in addition to
    the existing VS2005 and VS2003 projects
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>DataSourceAttribute</b> has been replaced with <b>FactoryAttribute</b>.
    The new attribute may refer to any field, method or property that 
	provides test cases consistent with the signature of the method on which
	it appears. The naming of this attribute is still a bit unsatisfactory
	and it may change in the final release. 
<li>The new <b>TestCaseFactoryAttribute</b> class may be used to mark a
    field, method or property that provides test cases. It specifies the
	argument types of the test cases that will be provided and is used
	to identify the cases to be used when the name of a factory is not
	specified.
<li>Data may be specified for individual arguments of a parameterized test
    using the new attributes: <b>ValuesAttribute</b>, <b>RangeAttribute</b>
	and <b>RandomAttribute</b>. By default, test cases are created using
	every possible combination of the items provided. Attributes on the
	test method may specify how data is combined. This release includes
	<b>SequentialAttribute</b>, <b>CombinatorialAttribute</b> (the default) and 
	<b>PairwiseAttribute</b>. However, Pairwise combination is not yet
	implemented, so that attribute is currently ignored.
<li><b>TestFixture</b> classes may now be generic. They must be marked with
    or or more instances of <b>TextFixtureAttribute</b> using the new
	constructor that takes an array of Types. NUnit will instantiate
	the fixture multiple times, using the type arguments provided.
<li>Parameterized test methods may now be generic. NUnit will deduce
    the correct implementation to use based on the types of the
	parameters provided.
<li>The new <b>RequiredAddinAttribute</b> may be used to mark tests,
    fixtures or assemblies, indicating the name of any addin that is
	required to run the tests. If the addin is not present, the test,
	fixture or assembly is marked NotRunnable.
<li>A new assertion and corresponding constraint <b>IsOrdered</b>
    has been added. (contributed by Simone Busoli)
<li><b>PlatformAttribute</b> has been extended to accept the new keywords
    <b>NT6</b>, <b>Vista</b> and <b>Win2008Server</b>.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> In the current alpha release, NUnit is unable to 
	distintuish between Vista and Windows 2008 Server. Either
	of them will match all the above values.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>Properties with a collection for a value are now displayed
displayed as a comma-separated list in the properties window.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The <b>IParameterProvider</b> interface has been replaced with
    <b>ITestCaseProvider</b>. The ParameterProviders extension point
	has been renamed to TestCaseProviders.
<li>A new extension point, <b>DataPointProviders</b>, has been
    added to support extensions that provide data for individual
	test parameters. Extensions must implement the <b>IDataPointProvider</b>
	interface.
<li>A simpler method of providing new data point extensions based
    on attributes applied to the parameter itself is also available.
    Such attributes may be derived from <b>ValuesAttribute</b> and
    do not require any special addin in order to work.
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit tests of AssertThrows were not working on systems using
    non-English cultures.
<li>Domains were not unloading correctly in some circumstances. Unloading
    is now done on a separate thread.
<li>An NUnitSettings.xml file of zero length was causing a crash. (from 2.4.8)
<li>Invoking the gui with /exclude:XXX, where XXX is a non-existent
    category, was causing all tests to be excluded. (from 2.4.8)
<li>Categories were not working properly on repeated tests. (from 2.4.8)
<li>A serious memory leak was fixed in the NUnit test runners. (from 2.4.8)
<li>Static SetUp and TearDown methods were not being called in a SetUpFixture.
<li>The current directory used when executing addins that load tests was
    not correctly set.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Alpha 2 Release - May 7, 2008</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> Since this is an alpha level release, the
features are not complete and some features present in
this release may be removed or changed in future releases.

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>This release includes pNUnit, an extended NUnit runner for distributed
    parallel tests. The pNUnit program was developed at Codice Software
	for use in testing the Plastic SCM and has been contributed to NUnit.
	For more info about using pNUnit see the 
	<a href="http://www.codicesoftware.com/opdownloads2/oppnunit.aspx">pNUnit site</a>.
<li>The install now offers Typical, Complete and Custom options. Selecting
    Typical gets you the NUnit framework, core, console runner and Gui.
    To install pNUnit, any of the bundled addins or the NUnit tests,
	select Complete or Custom.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>The RowTestExtension, which was merged into the nunit extension dlls
	in Alpha-1, is now provided as a separate addin. This is the general
	approach we plan to take with regard to any bundled addins, since it
	permits the creator of an addin to provide updates separately from
	the NUnit release.
<li>This release includes the CSUnitAddin extension, which allows the running of 
    CSUnit tests under NUnit. The csunit.dll must be available in order to
	run the tests.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Alpha 1 Release - April 18, 2008</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>There are no longer separate distributed packages for .NET 1.1 an 2.0.
    Both the binary zip and msi packages contain subdirectories for .NET
	1.1 and 2.0. In the case of the msi, the user may elect to install either
	or both of them.
<li>The Visual Studio solutions and projects are now in a directory tree that 
	is parallel to the source tree. This eliminates problems where the VS2003 
	and VS2005 builds were interfering with one another and makes room for 
	adding VS2008.
<li>NUnit is now built using NAnt 0.86 beta 1
<li>The windows installer is now created using WiX 2.0.5085
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>

<ul>
<li>Two new attributes have been added to support passing arguments
	to test methods:
	<ul>
	<li><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> allows the programmer to
		specify the arguments and a number of optional parameters inline.
	<li><b>DataSourceAttribute</b> identifies a static property that 
		will provide the arguments and other parameters.
	</ul>

<li>Two new constraints have been added to permit testing of
	application-created paths, without requiring that they exist in
	the file system. The following syntax is supported:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Is.SamePath(string)</b>
	<li><b>Is.SamePathOrUnder(string)</b>
	</ul>
	
<li>The DirectoryAssert class has been added, providing the following Methods:
	<ul>
	<li><b>AreEqual(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
	<li><b>AreEqual(string, string)</b>
	<li><b>AreNotEqual(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
	<li><b>AreNotEqual(string, string)</b>
	<li><b>IsEmpty(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
	<li><b>IsEmpty(string, string)</b>
	<li><b>IsNotEmpty(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
	<li><b>IsNotEmpty(string, string)</b>
	<li><b>IsWithin(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
	<li><b>IsWithin(string, string)</b>
	<li><b>IsNotWithin(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
	<li><b>IsNotWithin(string, string)</b>
	</ul>
	
<li>The method <b>Assert.Throws(Type expectedException, TestSnippet code)</b> 
	has been added to provide more control over tests of expected exceptions. 
	<b>TestSnippet</b> is a delegate, which may of course be supplied 
	anonymously under .NET 2.0. If the correct exception type is thrown,
	the actual exception is returned from the method, allowing further
	verification to be performed.
	
<li>The <b>Assert.DoesNotThrow</b> method may be used to verify that a
	delegate does not throw an exception.
	
<li>The <b>Assert.Pass</b> method allows early termination of a test with a
    successful result. 

<li>The <b>Assert.Inconclusive</b> method allows returning
	the new Inconclusive result state.

<li>NUnit now includes added funtionality in the .NET 2.0 build of
	the framework. The following additional features are supported:
	<ul>
	<li>All Asserts and Constraints work with nullable types. 
	<li>Some Asserts allow an alternate generic syntax for convenience:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Assert.IsInstanceOf&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.IsNotInstanceOf&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.IsAssignableFrom&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.Throws&lt;T&gt(TypeSnippet code);</b>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
<li>The following obsolete interfaces, classes and methods have been removed:
<ul>
	<li>The <b>IAsserter</b> interface
	<li>The <b>AbstractAsserter</b> class
	<li>The <b>Assertion</b> class
	<li>The <b>AssertionFailureMessage</b> class
	<li>The old <b>NUnit.Framework.TestCase</b> class used for inheriting test classes
	<li>The <b>Assert.DoAssert()</b> method
	<li>Two <b>ExpectedExceptionAttribute(Type, string)</b> constructor
	<li>Two <b>ExpectedExceptionAttribute(string, string)</b> constructor
</ul>

<li>The syntactic constructs in the <b>SyntaxHelpers</b> namespace have been
	moved to the <b>NUnit.Framework.Syntax.CSharp</b> namespace. The old
	namespace may still be used for existing classes, but will not be 
	supported after the 2.5 release.
	
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now allows use of static methods as tests and for SetUp, TearDown, 
    TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown.
<li>Failures and Errors are now distinquished internally and in summary reports.
    Methods that are not run because they are invalid are also reported separately.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The summary report now displays Errors, Failures, Inconclusive, Ignored and Skipped tests 
	separately. More detailed information on non-runnable tests and setup failures
	is provided.
<li>The console summary report is no longer created using a stylesheet, which
	renders the <b>/transform</b> option meaningless. The option has been removed.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The default gui display now uses a single tab for all text output. For
	users upgrading from an earlier release, the current settings are
	honored. If you wish to change to the new default, use the Restore Defaults
	button on the Text Output settings dialog.

<li>The final test run display shows a more detailed summary: passed tests,
    errors, failures, inconclusive, non-runnable, skipped and ignored.

<li>The status bar now displays errors and failures separately in.

<li>The tree display shows non-runnable tests in red and inconclusive tests
	in orange. Inconclusive tests are temporarily listed
	on the Tests Not Run tab for this alpha release.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<li>A new extension point <b>ParameterProviders</b> allows addins to 
	provide data for parameterized tests.
	
<li>The following extensions are included in the nunit.core.extensions
	and nunit.framework.extensions assemblies:
	<ul>
	<li>The MaxTime extension, which was previously a sample.
	<li>The RowTest extension, which remains an alternative to NUnit's
		native TestCase syntax.
	<li>The XmlConstraint extension, which allows comparing two xml files
	</ul> 
</ul>
