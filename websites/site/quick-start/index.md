## Tutorial
As developers, one of the fastest ways to learn a new technology is to build a toy application with it.  So that's the approach we are going to take to get you up and running with Lucene.NET.

To get started building your first application go to the [Tutorial](xref:quick-start/tutorial) page.

Some of these are part of the official Apache Lucene.NET project and others are from the community.  You will likely find both types of resources helpful.  So be sure to also checkout the [Learning Resources](xref:quick-start/learning-resources) page.
