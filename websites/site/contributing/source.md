Source code
===============

---------------

Apache Lucene.Net uses git as its source code management system. 

The official repository is here: __[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucenenet.git](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=lucenenet.git)__. 

You can clone the repo with the command line or your favorite Git client, example:

```
git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/lucenenet.git
```

There also is a mirror at GitHub __[https://github.com/apache/lucene.net](https://github.com/apache/lucene.net)__ which is synced from the Apache repository.

Most work currently happens on the branch named __branch_4x__.
