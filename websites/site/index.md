Lucene.NET
===============

<h2 id="about" class="text-center">About the project</h2>

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users

### Our Goals

* Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule
* Maintaining the high-performance requirements expected of a first class C# search engine library
* Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime
