Lucene.NET
===============

<h2 id="about" class="text-center">About the project</h2>

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.

### Latest Version - Lucene.NET 4.8.0 Beta

* The beta version is extremely stable
* Has more than 7800+ passing unit tests
* Integrates well with .NET 6.0, .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 2+
* Supports .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Standard 2.0 
* Supports .NET Framework 4.5+
* Some developers already use it in production environments

### Our Goals

* Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule
* Maintaining the high-performance requirements expected of a first class C# search engine library
* Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime
